## Abstract 
 The semantic graphics is the idea of labeling an area of interest with the minimum human labor. In our experiments,
 we have manually assigned a solid circle to the base of paddy and millet weed, and the rest of the pixels are counted as background. For more details and the experiments,
 please refer to the following paper, published  by our group:
 * Adhikari, S.P.; Yang, H.; Kim, H. Learning Semantic Graphics Using Convolutional Encoder–Decoder
 * Network for Autonomous Weeding in Paddy Field. Front. Plant Sci. 2019, 10, 1404.
