My name is Omnia Alwazzan. I am a computer science PhD student at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), working in the [ Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/) under the supervision of [Professor Greg Slabaugh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/slabaughgreg.html) and [Professor Ioannis](https://sites.google.com/view/ioannispatras/home). My research is centred on developing a multi-model fusion model for integrative healthcare. I'm particularly interested in developing novel fusion techniques that combine histological images with gene expression data.


## Previous Research and Experience 
 * I worked as a Research Assistant at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), [McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/institutes-and-facilities-overview/mcdonald-institute-archaeological-research) on facial expressions recognition in visual arts with [Dr Liliana Janik](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/directory/lj102), and [Professor Hatice Gunes](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~hg410/). I was also a part of [Affective Intelligence and Robotics Laboratory (AFAR) Group](https://cambridge-afar.github.io/)

* I completed my Master's Degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from [Jeonbuk National University (JBNU), Jeonju, Republic of Korea,](https://www.jbnu.ac.kr/kor/) (2019-2021) with research focused on fundamental Deep Learning and applications of Computer Vision to Healthcare and Precision Agriculture. I was supervised by [Professor Hyongsuk Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ywYodqAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Professor Yongchae Jeong
](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=VhkRkVUAAAAJ&hl=en), as well as working as a Research Assistant at [Core Research Institute of Intelligent Robots](https://robot.jbnu.ac.kr/robot/index.do).

* I obtained my Bachelor Degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering with <b> Magna Cum Laude </b> from [Bahria University Islamabad, (BUIC) Pakistan](https://www.bahria.edu.pk/) (2014-2018). I worked on Retinal layers segmentation in my final year and was supervised by [Dr. Taimur Hassan
](https://scholar.google.com.pk/citations?user=11mwy0YAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Research Interests
* My primary research interest is to solve vision-based problems like Segmentation, Detection, Depth Estimation, and Classification. 
* I also investigate topics related to Deep learning in Mobile Devices, Bioinformatics, Optical Flow and Signal Processing.


## Honors and Awards

During this period, I won the following Awards, Scholarships and Internships.
