My name is Omnia Alwazzan. I am a computer science PhD student at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), working in the [ Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/) under the supervision of [Professor Greg Slabaugh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/slabaughgreg.html) and [Professor Ioannis Patras](https://sites.google.com/view/ioannispatras/home). My research is centered on developing a deep multi-model fusion model for integrative healthcare. I'm particularly interested in developing novel fusion techniques that combine histological images with gene expression data using Deep Learning (DL) methods. My primary goal is to discover new deep-learning methodologies that could involve distinct modalities and leverage the significant information from each model to enhance clinical outcomes.


## Previous Experience 

 * Before and after completing my Master's degree, I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant at [King Abdul Aziz University](https://www.kau.edu.sa/home_english.aspx) and [University of Jeddah](https://www.uj.edu.sa/en) for computer science-based classes (5 years in total)

## Education  
* I obtained my Master's degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, Computer Science School at [Georgia State University (GSU)](https://www.gsu.edu/) in Atlanta, Georgia, United States (2017-2019). My research was focused on employing deep learning techniques in image captioning and classification projects. 

* I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer science from [King Abdul Aziz University](https://www.kau.edu.sa/home_english.aspx).

## Research Interests

- **Multi-Modal Fusion for Precision Medicine**  
  Developing AI models that integrate diverse data sources (e.g., imaging, omics, clinical records) to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

- **Biomedical Image Analysis and Interpretation**  
  Leveraging deep learning architectures (CNNs, Transformers, GNNs) for tasks such as segmentation, classification, and explainable decision-making in clinical settings.

- **Scalable AI Frameworks for Complex Healthcare Data**  
  Addressing challenges in heterogeneous datasets, missing modalities, and high-dimensional features through advanced fusion methods and robust data processing strategies.

## Honors and Awards
- Conducted a research project in collaboration with AstraZeneca as a research assistant, resulting in securing a [Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP)](https://www.ktp-uk.org/) grant,  Feb - Aug 2024
