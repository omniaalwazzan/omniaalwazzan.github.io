My name is Omnia Alwazzan. I am a computer science PhD student at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), working in the [ Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/) under the supervision of [Professor Greg Slabaugh](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/profiles/slabaughgreg.html) and [Professor Ioannis](https://sites.google.com/view/ioannispatras/home). My research is centred on developing a deep multi-model fusion model for integrative healthcare. I'm particularly interested in developing novel fusion techniques that combine histological images with gene expression data using Deep Learining (DL) methods. My passion is to dicsover new methodologies that could involve dsitinct modalities and leverge the signigicant information from each model to enhance the desred outcome 


## Previous Experience 
 * Before and after completeing my Master degree, I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant at [King Abdul Aziz University](https://www.kau.edu.sa/home_english.aspx) for computer science-based classes (5-years in total)

## Education  
* I obtained my Master degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, Computer Science School at [Georgia State University (GSU)](https://www.gsu.edu/) in Atlanta, Georgia, United States,(2017-2019). My research was focused in employing deep learning techniqes in image captioning and calssification projects. 

* I recieved my Bachelor Degree in Computer Scinece from [King Abdul Aziz University](https://www.kau.edu.sa/home_english.aspx).

## Research Interest 
* My passion is to discover new fusion methodologies that can incorporate various modalities and leverage the important information from each model to improve the desired outcome.
* I am  also looking for novel methods for classifying and segmenting medical images, as well as for localising and recognising objects of interest.
