## Our Contributions 

- We introduce a new method for segmenting both the left atrium and atrial scars sequentially to improve accuracy and efficiency compared to existing techniques.
- The Multi-scale weight sharing network (MSWS-Net) allows for better feature extraction at different image resolutions, potentially improving the segmentation accuracy.
- Our  Boundary2Patches method enhances the precision of segmentation, especially for complex structures like atrial scars.
- The proposed method combines anatomical information and texture features of the left atrium endocardium, leading to more robust segmentation.
